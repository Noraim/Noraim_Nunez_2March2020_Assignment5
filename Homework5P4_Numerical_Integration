# Numerican integration for Reimann Sum 

#Declaring variables 
sumarea = 0
a = 1
b = 9

#Printing Statement of Reimann sum formula 
print("Using Riemann sum to approximate the integral of y = 3x^3 - 4x^2 + 3.2198x\n")

# Printing output to ask the host for desired segment 
N = input("How many segments would you like your Reimen Sum to be?  ")

# Calculating the exponent of the general formula  
N = int(N)
delx = (b-a)/N
delx = float(delx)
print(delx)

# For loop to allow range in the hosts' input value 
for i in range(0, N-1):
  i = float(i)
  x = 1 + (i+0.5)*(delx)
  area = ((3*x*x*x) - (4*x*x) + (3.2198*x))*(delx)
  sumarea = sumarea + area

print("Your approximate integral from 1 to 9 is : ",sumarea)
