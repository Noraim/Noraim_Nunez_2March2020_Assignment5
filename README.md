Problem1: Standard Deviation like a Hipster - 
Write a program which calculates the standard deviation of this set without using sqrt function! 

Problem2: Sorting like a Hipster - 
Write a program in which sorts the data into an ascending array. Note: the 0th element in the list is the smallest, and the last element in the list is the largest. 

Problem3: Dataset Correlation like a Hipster - 
Calculate the “linear correlation coefficient” for the given set of data. Hence, you will need to solve for the expectation value of the dataset x and y values and solve for the mean and standard deviation for x or y. 

Problem4: Numerical Integration like a Hipster - 
Calculate the integral of the Reinmann Sum by writing a piece of code that performs this definite sum, y(x) = 3x3 − 4x2 + 3.2198x from a = 1 to b = 9. Perform this calculation analytically and then perform it numerically using your code for N =[10,50,100,200]. How close does this approximation approach to the analytic result.
