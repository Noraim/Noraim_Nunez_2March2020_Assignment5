Problem1: Standard Deviation Like a Hipster - 
Write a program which calculates the standard deviation of this set without using sqrt function! 

Problem2: Sorting Like a Hipster - 
Write a program in which sorts the data into an ascending array. Note: the 0th element in the list is the smallest, and the last element in the list is the largest. 

Problem3: Dataset Correlation Like a Hipster - 
Calculate the “linear correlation coefficient” for the given set of data. Hence, you will need to solve for the expectation value of the dataset x and y values and solve for the mean and standard deviation for x or y.
