# Calulcating the standard seviation of Array like a hipster 

# Defining array and sums 
num_array = list()
sum = 0
sumsqr = 0

# Print an output for the user to input a desired value from the array 
num = input("Enter how many elements you want:")
print ("Enter numbers in array: ")

# For loop to allow values into the array
for i in range(int(num)):
    n = input("num :")
    num_array.append(int(n))
    
# Sums the total values that are allowed into the array 
    sum = sum + int(n)

# Prints out the array 
print ("ARRAY: ",num_array)

# Gets the average of all the values
avg = (sum/(i+1))

#Squares the difference between the values and the average 
for j in range(i+1):
    sqr = (num_array[j]-int(avg))*(num_array[j]-int(avg))
# Sums the values from the squares differences 
    sumsqr = sumsqr + sqr

# Calculates the value in the sqrt to solve for standard deviation
insqrt = sumsqr/(i+1)

# Hard time with researching a loop equivilent to an exponent that will work correctly. Would appreciate a 
# solution just to learn how to correctly apply the loop because it drove me nuts! 
sqrt = insqrt**0.5

# Prints out the standard deviation of values 
print("Standard deviation of values : ", sqrt)
